## Additional Notes

### AWS Secrets Manager Integration
- The Secrets Manager is used to securely store sensitive data such as the Discord bot token, Claude API key, and other credentials.
- The boto3 SDK is used to retrieve these secrets for use in the application and for monitoring purposes.

### Security Event Logging
- The application logs security events such as secret access attempts and failures to help with auditing and security monitoring.

### Secret Access Metrics
- The application logs metrics related to secret access, such as the number of times secrets are retrieved and the success or failure of these retrievals.

### Error Tracking for Secret Retrieval
- The application logs errors related to secret retrieval to help with debugging and monitoring secret access.

### Structured Logging
- The application logs structured data to help with monitoring and debugging.

### Performance Monitoring
- The application logs metrics related to its performance, such as execution times and error rates.

### CI/CD Pipeline Validation
- The application's CI/CD pipeline validates the code quality and security of the deployed code.

### Pre-commit Hooks for Code Quality

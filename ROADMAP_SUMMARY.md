# AI Roast Den - Development Roadmap Summary

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED
**Problem**: Lambda's 15-minute timeout is incompatible with Discord's persistent WebSocket requirement.
**Solution**: Migrate to AWS Fargate for the Discord listener, keeping Lambda for message processing.

## Project Status: 20% Complete
### What's Done:
- Basic AWS infrastructure (CDK, Lambda, DynamoDB)
- Minimal Discord bot with !ask command
- Claude AI integration via Bedrock
- Secrets management setup

### What's Missing (80%):
- Persistent connection solution
- Personality system
- Memory implementation
- Safety features
- Multi-bot support
- Testing and monitoring

## 6-Week Sprint Plan

### Week 1 - Sprint 0: Emergency Architecture Fix
**Goal**: Solve the Lambda timeout issue
- Implement Fargate container for Discord bot
- Add SQS for async message processing
- Update CDK deployment
- Validate 24-hour persistent connection

### Week 2 - Sprint 1: Core Bot Functionality  
**Goal**: Personality-driven responses
- Create personality system with JSON configs
- Implement 3 starter personalities
- Add roasting logic
- Remove all hardcoded values

### Week 3 - Sprint 2: Memory System
**Goal**: Contextual conversations
- Short-term memory (100 messages)
- Long-term memory in DynamoDB
- Context-aware responses
- Memory-triggered callbacks

### Week 4 - Sprint 3: Safety & Production Readiness
**Goal**: Safe, scalable system
- Rate limiting (5 msg/user/min)
- Content filtering
- Admin controls
- Error handling

### Week 5 - Sprint 4: Multi-Bot Ecosystem
**Goal**: Multiple personalities interacting
- Bot registry system
- Inter-bot communication
- Group dynamics
- Conflict resolution

### Week 6 - Sprint 5: Higher Self Mode
**Goal**: Human-AI collaboration
- User-to-bot mapping
- Real-time influence system
- Behavior modification
- Monitoring dashboard

### Weeks 7-8 - Sprint 6: Production Polish
**Goal**: Launch-ready system
- Comprehensive testing (80% coverage)
- Performance optimization
- Complete documentation
- Cost optimization ($30-50/month)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Fargate Failure**: Fallback to EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
2. **API Limits**: Implement aggressive caching
3. **Cost Overruns**: Add usage caps and monitoring
4. **Content Issues**: Multi-layer filtering system

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: 99.9% uptime, <3s response time
- **User**: 80% retention, 4.5/5 satisfaction
- **Business**: $30-50/month operating cost
- **Features**: All planned features delivered

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Today**: Begin Fargate container development
2. **Day 2**: Implement SQS integration
3. **Day 3**: Test persistent connections
4. **Day 4**: Update CDK stack
5. **Day 5**: Deploy Sprint 0 solution

## Resource Requirements

- 1 Full-stack Developer (8 weeks)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (2 weeks, part-time)  
- 1 QA Tester (2 weeks, final phase)
- AWS Budget: $100/month during development

## Decision Gates

- **After Sprint 0**: Fargate working? (No â†’ EC2 pivot)
- **After Sprint 2**: Users engaged? (No â†’ Iterate personalities)
- **After Sprint 4**: Costs manageable? (No â†’ Optimize)
- **After Sprint 6**: Production ready? (No â†’ Extended beta)

This roadmap transforms the current 20% implementation into a production-ready AI personality system that creates engaging Discord communities through witty, context-aware bot interactions.

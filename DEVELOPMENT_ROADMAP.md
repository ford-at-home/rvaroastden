# AI Roast Den: Iterative Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap addresses the critical Lambda timeout issue that makes the current architecture incompatible with Discord bots, while providing a path to deliver value iteratively. The project is currently ~20% complete with basic infrastructure in place but missing core functionality.

**Critical Issue**: Discord bots require persistent WebSocket connections, but Lambda has a 15-minute maximum timeout. This fundamental incompatibility must be fixed immediately.

**Solution**: Migrate to AWS Fargate for the Discord listener while keeping Lambda for message processing, enabling both persistent connections and serverless scalability.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working (20% Complete)
- ✅ Basic AWS CDK infrastructure deployed
- ✅ Discord bot token in Secrets Manager
- ✅ Basic bot.py with minimal commands (!ask)
- ✅ Claude AI integration via Bedrock
- ✅ CloudWatch metrics collection
- ✅ DynamoDB table structure defined

### What's Missing (80% Remaining)
- ❌ Persistent Discord connection (Lambda timeout issue)
- ❌ Personality system (no JSON files or loading)
- ❌ Roasting logic and personality injection
- ❌ Memory system implementation
- ❌ Rate limiting and safety features
- ❌ Multi-bot support
- ❌ Higher Self Mode
- ❌ Testing infrastructure
- ❌ Monitoring and alerting
